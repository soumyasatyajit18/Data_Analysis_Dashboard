# Data_Analysis_Dashboard
I worked on an Insurance Analytics project aimed at analysing business performance and supporting management decision-making through data-driven insights. This project involved collecting and analysing multiple insurance operational datasets, including brokerage revenue, fee income, invoices, client meetings, budgets, and sales opportunities.
